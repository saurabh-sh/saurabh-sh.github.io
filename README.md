# My Portfolio

this is my personal portfolio created using Github Pages.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. 


## Fork

This site is forked from [Dinesh Pandiyan](https://flexdinesh.github.io).

This version changes color every time the site is refreshed.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

Here's mine [Saurabh Sharma](https://saurabh-sh.github.io)
